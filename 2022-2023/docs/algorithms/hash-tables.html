                        <h2>What is a hash table?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hash table is one of the most useful and widely used data structure in the world.<br><br> Imagine yourself to be a teacher who wants to select random students for a school play, but there should be a maximum of 5 students from
                            each class (out of 18 classes). The list given to you is unsorted. In such a case, it will take you a lot of time to find the name of students. <br><br> This process would take O(n) time.
                            <br><br> On the other hand, if you are given a sorted list of students, you will be able to find the student's name along with his/her class section without taking much time. Thus, this scenario would take O(log n) time.<br><br>                            Even with a sorted list of students, you will take a considerable amount of time. You will need a person who can memorize the location of each student's name and navigate you accordingly. How can you find such a person? This
                            is where hash functions come in.
                        </p><br><br>



                        <h2 id="hash-functions">Hash Functions</h2>
                        <p>A hash function is a function in which you input a string and get back a number.<br><br>A hash function matches a string to a number. You may think that there are no desirable patterns of numbers that get associated with a string.
                            However, there are two conditions.<br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Suppose you input John, and if you get "98" back, then each time you input John, you should get "98" back (since marks do not change).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It should map different words to different numbers. This means that it should not assign a single number, let's say "30" to all the strings (since it is very unlikely that all the students score the same marks).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p><br><br>

                        <h2>How is this related to our topic?</h2>
                        <p>
                            It turns out that the above algorithm is quite helpful to make the "person" that we talked about. Let us name that person "Clay" so that we can refer to the example easily in the future.
                        </p>
                        <br><br>

                        <h2>Making Clay</h2>
                        <p>
                            Here's the algorithm by which we will be able to make Clay. Input a random name, say George into the hash function. Let's say that the function attributes "George" to "10". We will then create an array and store our names and grade in that array. Then,
                            we will insert "George" along with his experience in school plays at index 10.
                            <br><br>Continuing this algorithm, we will end up with an array full of students. Now, if you want to find the class section of a random student, say "Aleesha". You will no longer have to look into the array or the unsorted
                            list. You can directly feed "Aleesha" to the hash function and get its position in the array (recall condition 1) to get the experience. You have now created your clay.<br><br>The hash function tells you directly where an item
                            is stored.

                        </p><br><br>

                        <h2>The Hash Table</h2>
                        <p>Combining a hash function and an array, you will get a hash table. It is way different from arrays and lists, which store data directly in the computer's memory. Hash tables, on the other hand, are smarter, and a lot faster.<br><br>If
                            you are experienced in Python, you might have already learned hash tables. They are called dictionaries in Python.</p><br><br>
                        <h2>Examples</h2>
                        <p>Some common use cases are the built-in phonebooks in your mobile.</p>
                        <div class="terminal">
                            <pre>
<span class="p">phone_book</span> = {
        "John Doe": <span class="str">5816609820</span>,
        "Jane Doe": <span class="str">4842344680</span>,
        "Mom": <span class="str">4155673579</span>
    }
</pre>
                        </div><br><br>
                        <p>
                            Another example is the IP address that is mapped to a particular website. Each website that you can find on the internet has a specific IP address built. This process is called DNS resolution.
                        </p><br><br>
                        <p>Another relatable example can be the voter's list. In general elections, naturally, a person can vote only once. The following terminal shows how hash functions can be used to program elections.
                        </p>

                        <div class="terminal">
                            <pre>
<span class="p">voted</span> = { }

<span class="h">def</span> <span class="p">checkVote</span>(name):
    <span class="h">if</span> name <span class="h">in</span> <span class="p">voted.keys()</span>:
        print(<span class="p">f</span><span class="str">"Kick</span> {name} <span class="str">out!"</span>)
    <span class="h">else</span>:
        voted[<span class="p">name</span>] = <span class="str">1</span>
        print(<span class="str">"Welcome the new voter"</span>)

<span class="p">checkVote</span>(<span class="str">'John'</span>)
<span class="p">checkVote</span>(<span class="str">'Tom'</span>)
<span class="p">checkVote</span>(<span class="str">'Tom'</span>)
</pre>
                        </div><br><br>
                        <h2 id="caching">Caching</h2>
                        <p>Caching can be considered as an example of hash tables too. Caching is just as simple as making the client-side devices (customer's devices) memorize the data that they search over and over again. For example, if you search "Java"
                            over and over again in Google, you may get either of the results:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java: A programming language</li>
                            <li>Java: A country in South-East Asia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The google website saves your behavior in the form of cache on your device to match the results to your query. This also helps to reduce the load on Google's server, making the process a whole lot faster in the long run.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h2>How is this relevant to our topic?</h2>
                        <p>Caching is another example of a hash table since the data stored as cache is stored in the form of a hash. A key, maybe the query you searched for, is mapped to the number of times of which you searched for that query.</p>
                        <p>Google then shows you data relevant to the "most-searched" data by you.</p>
                        <div class="terminal">
                            <pre>

<span class="p">cache</span> = { }

<i><span class="c"># Query is the question/data that you typed in the search bar.</span></i>

<span class="h">def</span> <span class="p">showResult</span>(query):
    <span class="h">if</span> query <span class="h">in</span> <span class="p">cache.keys</span>():
        cache</span>[<span class="p">query</span>] += <span class="str">1</span>
    <span class="h">else</span>:
        cache[<span class="p">query</span>] = <span class="str">1</span>

<span class="c"># google.search() is the search algorithm for google to navigate you to your result page.<br>That has not been defined here.</span>
<span class="p">google.search</span>(query[url])
</pre>
                        </div><br><br>
                        <h2 id="collisions">Collisions</h2>
                        <p>Collisions occur when two keys get assigned the same slot in the array. The name "Adrienne" in our hash table may overwrite "Adrian" in the array. A common solution to prevent such collisions is by using linked lists in that hash
                            table. But, this would slow down its speed.</p><br><br>


                        <h2 id="performance">Performance of Hash Tables</h2>
                        <p>Hash tables take O(1) time, which means that it is constant. Thus, its performance doesn't depend on how large a hash table is. A hash table with 1 billion elements will produce output just as fast as another hash table with 1
                            element.
                        </p><br><br>

                        <h2>Comparison of Hash Tables with Arrays and Lists</h2>
                        <p>By looking at the average case of hash tables, they are as fast as arrays at searching. They are also as fast as linked lists when it comes to deletions and insertions. The average case scenario thus seems to be the best in both
                            contexts. However, when we look at the worst-case scenario, it is the worst of both worlds.<br><br>Worst-case scenarios mainly involve collisions. Thus, avoiding collisions will simply prevent the worst-case scenario from occurring.<br>For
                            this, you may need:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    A low load factor...(see below for definition)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A good hash function...(having values arranged orderly)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p><br><br>

                        <h2 id="load-factor">Load Factor</h2>
                        <p>The load factor can be calculated by dividing the number of items in a hash table by the total number of slots. Thus, it calculates the number of slots occupied in a given array.<br><br>The best-case scenario is when the load factor
                            is less than 1. It would imply that each item in the array has at least 1 slot to itself. The worst-case scenario is when the load factor is more than 1. It would imply that not all items in an array have an entire slot to
                            themselves.
                            <br><br>To avoid the worst-case scenario that was mentioned above, we will need to resize the hash table to probably twice the size.<br><br>It is generally recommended to resize the array when the load factor grows equal to
                            or more than 0.7. Resizing is expensive and may cost a lot of time (can be subtly experienced by the user). But it turns out that hash tables take O(1) time even including resizing.</p>
