                <p class="main">My opinions on where and how aspirant programmers should start, and remain productive throughout their journey.</p><br><br><br>


                <h3>Basics First</h3>
                <p>Before making an entry into computers by learning programming languages, you should have a strong base about how computers work. This knowledge will not only help you in your future projects, but will also help you understand the interaction
                    between programming languages and the Operating System. Having general knowledge about the terminal, for example, will help to dive deeper into execution of code.</p>
                <br><br><br>

                <h3>Choosing a language</h3>
                <p>Choosing a programming language has become difficult in the present day world, since a large number of them are available readily. While each of them is better than the other in its unique way, it may not necessarily mean that they are
                    equally easy to learn. Python and JavaScript are usually opted by people for starting their programming journey. I suggest that you must start with mark-up languages like HTML, CSS and JS. After mastering them, proceeding towards learning
                    Python is a good choice. If Python isn't enough to quench your thirst, and you want to learn even more programming languages, Kotlin is a good option because of its Cross-Platform feature.</p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Staying productive</h3>
                <p>
                    After mastering at least one programming language, I suggest you to begin with solving problems that were asked in job interviews. I personally tried this, and believe me, I was able to learn and understand many new concepts. It is a whole different kind
                    of exposure. When you solve one problem, you get instant motivation to move on to the other. Thus, you gain self confidence. But if you get stuck anywhere, you might get frustrated. This is what often happened to me.<br><br>So,
                    all I did was take a break. In this break, I allowed my mind to refresh itself. I used to study in my break, because I was in school when I started programming (and I obviously did not want to lag behind in there). After a couple of
                    days, or maybe weeks, I used to come back to programming with a fresh mind. It was only then when I could solve the hard problems without any frustration.
                </p><br><br><br>
                <h3>Communities</h3>
                <p>
                    You can also join popular communities like StackOverflow and GitHub to ask your questions to programmers of the world, and also answer their questions. This is a promising opportunity for you to expand your knowledge over a particular topic, and staying
                    up-to-date with the news and trends.

                    So, this is it for this blog. Stay healthy, stay safe, and exercise your programming skills daily. All the best!
