                <h1 class="title">My Special Internship Experience</h1>
                <p class="main">I was an intern at Findability Sciences, Aurangabad. This blog narrates my experience and all I got to learn there.</p><br><br><br>
            </div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Findability Sciences (FS) is a leading enterprise artificial intelligence company that operates in the United States of America, India, and Japan. I was an intern at FS from 25th April to 25th May. Besides meeting the awesome staff, I had a wonderful
                time learning there. I entered the office on the first day with my eyes shining, excited to know more about my favorite subject. On the last day, I returned home with more interest and curiosity about the topic.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <h3>My Assignments</h3>
            <p>
                Mr. Mandar Kulkarni was my supervisor. My first task was to prepare an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an initiative by the Government of Maharashtra. It discussed how Defense and Aerospace Engineering departments in Maharashtra could incorporate Artificial
                Intelligence (AI). I was bouncing from one desk to another, talking with the staff, and hoping to camouflage in the corporate environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt like the spring festivals had begun - I had an infinite source of knowledge waiting - just that month.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my second assignment, Mr. Shravan Inamdar supervised me. This time, I had to work with real-time data for one of our clients, who were from a big real-estate corporate. My task was to prepare reports on the real-estate conditions in several Metropolitan
                Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the U.S. By the end of the week, I had completed 4 reports about 26 MSAs. Mr. Shravan Inamdar was very impressed by my speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, I was confused as I did not see any link connecting machine learning and report writing. But as I progressed, I understood that such reports make up about 20% of machine learning. Interesting, isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, it was time to learn something new: the basics of the coding part of machine learning. I have made separate documentation of
                <a href="../docs/machine-learning/index.html" target="_blank">everything I learned there.</a></p>
            <p>My other tasks included plotting graphs and sending them for presentations to clients. I could also add my learnings to my technical blog called
                <a href="../../TheArchive/index.html" target="_blank">The Techies.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                This internship opened up a new dimension for me. It was a dimension that changed my outlook toward AI as something more than a career - it was a passion. I was quick to accept this passion, all thanks to the wonderful team.
            </p><br><br><br>

            <p>
                In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to Findability Sciences, Mr. Suresh Shakkarwar, Mr. Mandar Kulkarni, and Mr. Shravan Inamdar for helping me to gain valuable insights about my 'aspiring' career. Their guidance also helped me witness a
                corporate environment. I would also like to thank Mr. Gajanan for serving me delicious lemonade and keeping me hydrated.
