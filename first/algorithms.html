        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>What is an algorithm?</h3>
        <p>An algorithm is a set of instructions followed to accomplish a task. For instance, take a trip from your
            house to your school. It involves an algorithm of directions. You follow a particular code (set) of
            instructions to reach your destination. In this example, it is simply the directions (left, right, etc.).
            So, unknowingly, we all use algorithms in day-to-day life without even realizing it. The brain is indeed a
            mystery. In the following lessons, I will be focussing on algorithms used to accomplish a task that you
            provide to your computer. The algorithms mentioned further have been written in Python. However, pseudocode
            has been used at some places for those without any experience in programming languages. 'Algorithms' is a
            vast topic, thus I have covered only the important topics. View <a href="sources.html"
                target="_blank">Sources</a> for
            sources of this information.
        </p><br>
        <hr><br>
        <h1>How are items stored in a computer?</h1>
        <p>Imagine a computer to be a bookshelf that is already filled with some books, but is not full. The books that
            already occupy the bookshelf are kept in a random order and not next to each other. Consider the items that
            you want to be stored in the bookshelf to be books. Further explanation has been split into two datatypes:
            arrays and lists to understand two different cases of memory storage.</p>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>In arrays, their elements are stored one after the other on the shelf, just like books, in the order
            specified. Take, for example, that there is a shelf and you have 10 books to be stored. But, the maximum
            capacity for accommodating it in the bookshelf one after the other is seven (and the eighth position is
            occupied by something else). The books cannot be stored in an array, thus leading to problems dealing with
            memory. The elements cannot be spread over the place, like in the case of lists.</p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>In lists, their elements are stored in order, but not necessarily one after the other. The elements are
            spread over to occupy any given space. Take for example that there are 10 books to be arranged. But, the
            maximum capacity for accommodating it in the bookshelf one after the other is seven (and the eighth position
            is occupied by something else). In lists, the first seven elements get stored in the order provided, while
            the other elements occur after the seventh position. One element stores the link of the next one.</p><br>
        <hr><br>
        <h1>Types of Searches</h1>
        <p>Searching through long lists or arrays has always caused headaches to new programmers. There are mainly two
            ways by which we can classify our methods to search a particular item in a long list.
            These searches can be best depicted by a common game we might have played as children: the guessing game.
            Consider that you are playing a game with your friend - you tell your friend to guess a number that you are
            thinking about and give him a range (for example, 0 to 100). With each guess, you tell him/her if her guess
            is too high or too low. If the guess is correct, you tell him to stop.</p>
        <h3>Simple Search</h3>
        <p>The simple search is a method of searching an element in the array right from the beginning. The search
            starts from the first position (index 0) and keeps shifting by one position till the required element is
            found. Thus, considering the above given example, the simple search starts from 0 and ends at 100 (till the
            element is found).</p>
        <h3>Binary Search</h3>
        <p>The binary search starts at the arithmetic mean of the range. Considering the above example, the search
            starts at 50. Then, a guess is made. If the guess is too low, the range (50-100) is considered. Else, the
            range (0-50) is considered and the same algorithm is repeated.</p>

        <h3>Algorithm running times grow at different rates</h3>
        <p id="bigo">The binary search witnesses a low-slope increment in the number of functions it carries as well as
            the time
            as the number of items in the array increases. Thus, binary search provides a fast result.
            Simple search, on the other hand, has a steeper slope when it comes to the number of tasks carried out.
            Thus, it takes more time than binary search.</p>

        <h3>The Big O</h3>
        <p>The Big O notation is a simple method that tells you how fast a computer program runs. However, it doesn't
            measure the time taken by the algorithm. It denotes the number of tasks that that particular algorithm
            takes.</p>

        <p>The following table depicts the run times for simple search and binary search.</p><br>
        <div class="centroid">
            <table style="width: 80%;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Simple Search</th>
                    <th>Binary Search</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>100 items —> 100 guesses</td>
                    <td>100 items -> 7 guesses</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4,000,000,000 items —> 4,000,000,000 guesses</td>
                    <td>4,000,000,000 items -> 32 guesses</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>O(n)...Linear Time</td>
                    <td>O(log n)…..Logarithmic Time</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <br>
        <em>This table measures the maximum possible guesses it may take.</em>
        <br>
        <p>As you can see, binary search takes very few guesses, thus making it far more efficient than simple search.
            However, everything has its own disadvantages. As binary search follows a complicated algorithm, it
            increases the chances of bugs and errors. Simple search, after iterating over the complete array, reduces
            the chances of any such bugs and errors to a negligible extent.</p>
        <h3>Applications and need of such techniques</h3>
        <p>Imagine yourself writing a program for social media websites. You have been assigned to write a program that
            goes through an array of all users and provides the users relevant data of the value they input in a search
            box. This is where your search algorithm comes into play. You must consider that you are working with arrays
            with billions of elements in them. Thus, the speed should be fast and with minimum code.</p>
        <h3>Some Common Big O run times</h3>
        <p>From fastest to slowest<br>
        <ol>
            <li>O (log n), also known as log time. Example: Binary search.</li>
            <li>O(n), also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.</li>
            <li>O(n*log n). Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quick-sort.</li>
            <li>O(n^2). Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.</li>
            <li>O(n!). Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.</li>

        <h1>Algorithms for Arrays and Lists</h1>
        <h3>Appendage and Insertions</h3>
        <p>Appending elements means adding elements to the last of a pre-existing list. This activity is seen in nearly
            all the programs that manage a database.<br>Insertions means inserting an element in any position in an
            array/list.<br><br>
            <b>Lists:</b> With the availability of free space anywhere in the computer (as mentioned in How Are Items
            Stored in
            a Computer), the newly appended elements can be arranged anywhere. Considering the general example, books
            can be put in any available slot, it is that easy.<br><br><b>Arrays:</b> The same doesn't hold true for
            arrays. If
            consecutive space is not available to store the element(s) to be appended, the entire array has to be
            shifted to some other place. Thus, the position of every element has to be
            shifted.<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> Lists are better than arrays in this respect.
        </p>
        <h3>Deletion</h3>
        <p>Deletion is the process of deleting an element from an array/list. While appendage is not always possible
            (due to insufficient memory or other conditions), deletion of any element in the list/array is always
            possible.<br><br>
            <b>Lists</b>: By deleting an element in a list, you just change what the previous elements point to. Thus,
            it
            becomes time and memory-efficient.<br><br>
            <b>Arrays</b>: By deleting an element in an array, the entire array has to be moved up by one space. This
            involves
            a lot of processing and leads to a slow code when working with arrays containing billions of
            elements.<br><br>
            <b>Conclusion</b>: Thus, lists are definitely better than arrays when it comes to deletion.

        <h4 class="t">Comparison of usage frequency of lists and arrays</h4>
        <p>Usage of these datatypes heavily depends on the nature of the project you are working on. Arrays can store
            data very compactly and are more efficient for storing large amounts of data. Arrays are great for numerical
            operations; lists cannot directly handle math operations. For example, you can divide each element of an
            array by the same number with just one line of code. However, lists are faster.<br>
            Arrays see a lot of use. This is because it functions on the fundamentals of random access. On the other
            hand, linked lists function on sequential access.</p>
        <p><b>Sequential Access:</b> This process accesses the required element beginning from the start. Thinking of it
            in
            terms of bookshelf and books, it finds the required book after going through the entire bookshelf at least
            once and then pointing that book out.<br><br>
            <b>Random Access:</b> This process may begin at any position. It may directly jump to the eighth position,
            saving
            us a lot of time.

        <h1>Recursion</h1>
        <h3>What are recursive programs?</h3>
        <p>Recursive programs are those which keep calling themselves until they are told to stop. If not stopped, they
            can perform infinite loops.</p>
        <div class="centroid">
            <pre>
                <code>
def greet(name):
    print(f"hello, {name}!")
    greet2(name)
    print("getting ready to say bye...")

def greet2(name):
    print((f"How are you {name}?"))

    def bye():
        print("ok bye!")
    bye()

greet(("Ved"))


def fact(x): #fact -> factorial
    if x == 1:

        <h3>Cases in recursive code</h3>
        <p><b>Recursive Case:</b> This is the case when the function calls itself and thus, leads to an infinite
            loop.<br><br>
            <b>Base Case</b>: This is the code that is added to the code block to prevent recursions.

        <h1>Stacking</h1>
        <p>Stacking is a common terminology when you learn to program. It can be best explained with an analogy.<br>
            Imagine that you are having a stack of playing cards with you. The elements in a list and arrays are stored
            in the same way. There are two functions that you can perform with the given lists and arrays.</p>
        <h3>Push</h3>
        <p>It is the same as appending to the end of the list. For example, adding a card to the stack of cards.</p>
        <h3>Pop</h3>
        <p>It is reading the topmost element and then removing it. For example, this function reads the top-most card in
            the stack and then pops it off the stack.</p>
        <h3>How is this related to our topic?</h3>
        <p>Well, it turns out that the functions that we write work in a similar manner. They get stacked one over the
            other and are perceived by the computer in this way.</p>
        <h3>Why is Stack Algorithm necessary to be known?</h3>
        <p>With stack, you do not have to keep a check on the functions that have been completed. The stack function
            does it for you.<br>
            Using stack is convenient but there is a cost: saving all that info can take up a lot of memory. Each of
            those function calls takes up some memory. At that point, you may choose any of the following courses:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Rewrite the code to use a loop instead.</li>
            <li>Use tail recursion. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Both are equally effective and widely used. Tail recursion is supported by some languages, but not all of
            them. Thus, the first course is suggested to new programmers.</p><br>

        <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
        <p>In this section, we will discuss different types of sorting algorithms.</p>
        <h3>What are sorting algorithms?</h3>
        <p>Suppose you are given a list and an array, each containing billions of elements. You are assigned to sort all
            the elements in alphabetical order. To maximize your program, you use an algorithm that gets you the output
            in the minimum time.</p>
        <h3>What are different types of sorting algorithms?</h3>
        <p>In this documentation, we will be broadly classifying the sorting algorithms into two parts:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Selection sort</li>
            <li>Quick sort</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction to Selection Sort</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is neat-looking, but not necessarily fast. In this documentation, we will be focussing on
            Quick Sort algorithms.</p>
        <h3>Introduction to Quick Sort</h3>
        <p>Quicksort is a well-known recursive technique used to solve problems. It is a type of Divide-and-Conquer
            Technique (D&C). It is a sorting algorithm and a much faster one as compared to selection sort. It can be
            solved in the following two ways:
        <ol>
            <li>Figure out the base case. It should be the simplest case.</li>
            <li>Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Application of Quicksort</h3>
        <p>Imagine that you plot grounds for your company. One of your clients wants a piece of 600 meters x 400 meters
            land divided into the largest possible number of squares. What is the length of such a square?<br>
            I will let this question haunt your days and nights till you come up with the solution. Only then will you
            be content to proceed with the following documentation.<br><b>Hint: It easier with GCF.</b></p>
        <p>If you were able to solve the problem without the hint, give yourself a pat on the back. You are ready for
            the rest of the documentation. If you weren't able to solve this problem, don't worry.
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khanacademy.org</a> gives you an in-depth
                understanding of such problems.</li>
            <li>Or, refer to Indian Central Board books for Classes 7 and above. You will find your answer.</li>
